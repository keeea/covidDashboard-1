## Abstract
### Situation

COVID-19 has been spread worldwide since 2019, and there has been a new peek of the outbreak in the US at the beginning of 2021. So it is still significantly necessary for the government and institutions that face crowd gathering risk in Philadelphia to track the trend of reported cases, death, and hospitalization condition of COVID. In addition, as COVID vaccines are developed and used this year, the government and other stakeholders, such as universities, start to pay more attention to vaccine coverage, breakthrough infections, and hospitalization accessibility.

### Decision Metrics

First and foremost, this COVID dashboard will help to **track general infection trends** by time curve and 14-day changes of reported cases, death, hospitalization, and vaccination. Also, age, racial and sexual composition will be demonstrated to assist government and stakeholders in **identifying how to allocate related resources**. On top of that, hot pot maps by zip code will be helpful in **targeting breakout places and containing the spread of the epidemic promptly**. What's more important, the dashboard will combine data from different sources and engineer effect metrics and graphics, including ratio of positive test/vaccinated that will contribute to **simulate breakthrough infections**, ratio of treated/death that will contribute to **warn higher mortality due to poor hospitalization accessibility**, and a multiple line plot of hospitalization & vaccine that help to **explore whether neighborhoods are not active to take vaccine are more apt to not be hospitalized**.

## Data Sources
We choose four aspects of COVID-19 data, confirmed cases, hospitalization, death and vaccination mainly from [OpenDataPhilly](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/covid-cases). Some data from [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/browse) might also be considered. The data form that we will utilized in our project includes csv, geojson, shp and API.  We will also use the aggregated number by different groups of sex, race and age categories provided by all these datasets. Both real-time and historical data by ZIP is needed in our project. All the datasets are open-accessed to us.
